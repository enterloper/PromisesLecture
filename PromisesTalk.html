    <h2>What is a promise?</h2>
    <p>The core idea behind promises is that a promise represents the result of an asynchronous operation. A promise is in one of three different states:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>pending - The initial state of a promise.</li>
      <li>fulfilled - The state of a promise representing a successful operation.</li>
      <li>rejected - The state of a promise representing a failed operation.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Once a promise is fulfilled or rejected, it is immutable (i.e. it can never change again).</p>
